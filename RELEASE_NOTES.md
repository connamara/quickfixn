**NOTE: Breaking changes in release**  
This version has changes that technically alter the public interface.
Most likely no one is affected.  But just in case, here are the details:

* **class `OtherTagException` was deleted.**  The class `GroupDelimiterTagException` used to
  be descended from this class, but now descends directly from `TagException`.
* **method `Session.Next(Message message)` was deleted.**  This should never have been public.
  If you were using it and this is a problem for you, please contact us
  via our [Contact Page](http://quickfixn.org/about/contact) and we'll see if we can help.
