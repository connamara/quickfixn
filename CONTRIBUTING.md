* If you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one, suggest your change in the QuickFIX/n mailing list and start writing code.  Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.
* If possible, please refrain from changing public interface code.  We would like to limit breaking legacy code that uses the library as much as possible.
