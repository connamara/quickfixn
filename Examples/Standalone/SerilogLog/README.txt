Sample QuickFix.ILog Implementation
===================================

This is an example of enriching QuickFIX/N logging using a 3rd party NuGet
(Serilog.Sinks.File in this case). Features added are rolling log files 
and limited total log size.

The solution contains 2 projects:

1. The SerilogLog is a sample implementation of ILog and ILogFactory.
NOTE: this is a sample, NOT a finished ready-to-use product.
Follow comments in the source code to adjust the example to 
your actual requirements.

2. The UnitTests are proof that limits for log size are working.

The projects are dependent on QuickFix.dll (ILog and ILogFactory interfaces).
Assuming the standard directory structure, the reference path is:
...\QuickFIXn\bin\Release\netstandard2.0\QuickFix.dll
You need to build QuickFIXn release configuration to have the DLL available.
Alternatively, you can change the reference in the both projects.

If you copy/paste the source code in your project, you need to have
references to QuickFix.dll and NuGet Serilog.Sinks.File installed.

Usage example:
    ILogFactory logFactory = new SerilogLogFactory(settings);
    ThreadedSocketAcceptor _acceptor = new ThreadedSocketAcceptor(executorApp,
        storeFactory, settings, logFactory);
- all sessions created by this `_acceptor` will be using SerilogLog
for messages and events logging.
