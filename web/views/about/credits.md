Thanks to **Oren Miller**, the creator of QuickFIX, who imbued the FIX world 
with a reference implementation of FIX when it desperately needed it, and who
generously supported our efforts to bring his ideas to a native .NET 
implementation.  This project would have taken significantly longer 
and launched with significantly more bugs had we not been able to copy 
the hundreds of acceptance tests that ship with his original QuickFIX 
project. 

Thanks to **Jim Downs**, CEO of Connamara Systems, who took our baby project 
into his company and gave it a final push into reality.
