This is the QuickFIX/n Core. This package contains the core QF/n engine, but none of the message definitions.

You most likely also need one or more message definition packages:
* If you are using a FIX4 release, you probably want the corresponding QuickFIXn.FIX.4.* package.
* If you are using a FIX5 release, you probably want the QuickFIXn.FIXT1.1 package **and**
a the corresponding QuickFIXn.FIX5.0* package

**This is an official NuGet package from QuickFIXn.org.**
